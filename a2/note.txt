Goal of assignment 2: rewrite our language in jcup format (refer to tut1)

We'll be using a program called `ant`. Seems similar to make

Typical workflow:
    1. ant gettools         # get all tools, such as JCup
    2. ant jflex            # build parser -> Parser.java
    3. ant compiler488
    4. ant dist             # creates RUNCOMPILER.sh

When submitting, make sure to do `ant distclean`

Modifying csc488.cup
    - make sure to write "start with program" to let the parser know
    - remember order of operation matters (need to multiply before adding for ex)
        + can use "precedence" to allow setting priorities
