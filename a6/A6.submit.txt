What to submit / What to submit for Assignment 6

1) Submit  tar ball named  csc488h.A6.XY.tar  (where XY is your team number).
   If more than one tar ball is submitted by a team we will use the most
   recent one.

The tar ball should contain:

a) a complete compilable source tree for your Assignment 5 compiler.
   We will compile your compiler from source and run it on our test cases.

   We will build your compiler for our testing by doing

   		ant distclean		# just to be sure
		ant gettools
		ant dist

    and will use the compiler  dist/compiler488.jar   in our testing.

  We don't need/want compiled files, so do  "ant distclean"  before
  you tar your source tree.   

  We do not need/want the javadoc for your compiler.  We can generate
  it if required.  "ant distclean" will remove the javadoc

  [The truly paranoid will verify that their compiler
   can be recompiled from the directory tree in the tar ball on CDF.
   Paranoia is recommended by many software engineers including the instructor.]


b) Given an input file XY.488, your compiler should generate an assembly file 
   XY.asm (XY should match the real file name). Please make sure the stand alone 
   virtual machine is able to read and execute the generated asembly file.

   The format of generated ASM file should be:

INSTRUCTION1 ARG1 ARG2
INSTRUCTION2 ARG1 ARG2
...

c) To run the standalone virtual machine. 

```
cd VM
./DOJAVA
./RUN -A XY.asm
```

  We have also provided an example program (program.488) and an assembly 
  file (program.asm).
